            <h2>Site Name</h2>
            <p>
                The name I have chosen for my site will be called "Bluey's Beauty." The business is inspired by my current line of work. The characters and information will be inspired by the show "Bluey." I wanted to combine my  willingness to learn and involving my children for family time.

            <h2>Site Purpose</h2>
            <p>
                The site will give information to perspective clients about services offered by this hair salon, a chance to book an appointment, and learn about who the stylists are.

            <h2>Scenarios</h2>
            <p>
                <b>Scenario 1:</b> My hair has been growing for a few years and it's long, dry, and boring. What should I do?<br>ðŸ¦‹ Our salon offers many services that can take care of your issues. From something as simple as a deep conditioning treatment, or something more complex like a haircut or color, the choices you can make are endless.<br>
                <br><b>Scenario 2:</b> I know this is last minute, but I need someone to style my hair for a friend's wedding. Will someone be able to take me in on the day of the wedding?<br>ðŸ¦‹ We have many stylists in our salon who specialize in updos. You can take advantage of the online appointment booking to save an appointment time for you.

            <h2>Color Schema</h2>
            <p>
                I'm sure as the project progresses, I'll be adding more colors. So far, I have selected to use these color combinations:
            </p><br>

            <div class="heading-box">Header font color: rgb(7, 109, 211)</div>
            <div class="body-box">Body font/shadowing color: rgb(43, 44, 65)</div>
            <div class="back-box">Background color: rgb(252, 252, 234)</div>
            <div class="extra">Extra blue color: rgb(10, 167, 240);</div>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Typography</h2>
            <p>
                Thanks to <a href="https://fonts.google.com/">Google Fonts</a>, I have selected these two fonts: <br><br>
                <div class="heading-font">Heading font: Playpen Sans</div>
                <div class="body-font">Body font: Edu SA Beginner</div>
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Wireframes</h2>
            <p>
                To draw a wireframe, I used my favorite: <a href="https://excalidraw.com">Excalidraw</a>. Here is an idea or visual of what I would like my homepage to look like:
            </p><br>
            <div class="wireframe">
                <img src="images/wireframe.webp" alt="wireframe for mobile and desktop view" width="500" height="500">
            </div>
        </section>
